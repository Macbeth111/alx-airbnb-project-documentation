Airbnb Backend - Property Booking Flow

This document provides a detailed overview of the Property Booking process for an Airbnb-like backend architecture, describing how booking requests are validated, processed, persisted, and communicated to other systems.
Booking Process Overview

The booking workflow includes the following high-level steps:

    User Client initiates a booking request through the app or website.
    The request passes through the API Gateway to reach backend services.
    The Booking Service handles booking-related business logic.
    Booking validation is performed to ensure:
        The property is available.
        The user is eligible.
        Pricing is correct.
    Payment is processed via the Payment Gateway.
    Upon successful payment, the booking is confirmed and stored in the transactional database.
    A notification is sent to the user to confirm the booking (via email or push notification).
    The booking event is published on the Event Bus (Kafka) for asynchronous downstream consumers (such as analytics, host notifications, or recommendation engines).
    Analytics services consume these events to track performance and user behavior.
