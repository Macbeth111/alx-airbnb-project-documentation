### **User Story 1: Saved Listings (Wishlist)**

**As a guest,**
I want to be able to save properties to a wishlist,
**so that** I can easily return to and compare listings I’m interested in before making a booking.

**As a guest,**
I want to view a property’s real-time availability calendar,
**so that** I can quickly identify open dates and avoid booking conflicts.

For hosts, this helps them manage reservations across multiple platforms (if integrated with iCal or other APIs).

### **User Story 3: Host Identity Verification**

**As a host,**
I want to verify my identity with official documents,
**so that** guests feel safe and trust the legitimacy of my listing.

**Definition:**
This feature ensures platform trust and safety by requiring hosts to upload valid government-issued IDs, which are then validated (manually or via automated document scanning). Verified badges improve guest confidence and reduce fraudulent listings.

### **User Story 4: Guest Check-In Instructions**

**As a host,**
I want to upload and manage custom check-in instructions for each listing,
**so that** guests can have a smooth arrival experience without needing to contact me.

This functionality allows hosts to share tailored directions, door codes, or smart lock details per property. It automates the guest onboarding experience, reducing friction and host workload. Integration with messaging or email notifications can enhance delivery of this information.

### **User Story 5: Incident Reporting System**

**As a guest or host,**
I want to be able to report issues during or after a stay (e.g., damage, misconduct),
**so that** the platform can mediate and take appropriate action.

**Definition:**
This story introduces a structured issue-reporting mechanism, with categories, evidence upload, and communication threads. It ensures accountability, protects both parties, and supports the dispute resolution process—often backed by AI triaging or admin escalation workflows.
