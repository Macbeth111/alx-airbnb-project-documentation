### **User Story 1: Role-Based Account Registration**

**As a first-time user,**
I want the option to sign up either as a guest looking to book stays or as a host offering properties,
**so that** I can access tailored features and workflows based on my role on the platform.

**Definition:**
This story introduces a dual-path registration flow that prompts users to identify their purpose on the platform—either as a guest or a host. This distinction is essential because each role interacts with different services (e.g., booking vs. listing). It enables backend role-based access control (RBAC), personalized onboarding, and distinct dashboards for guests and hosts.

### **User Story 2: Intelligent Search and Recommendations**

**As a guest,**
I want to search for available properties using filters like location, budget, and amenities, and receive personalized, AI-powered suggestions,
**so that** I can find accommodations that best match my preferences and travel context.

**Definition:**
This user story revolves around a smart discovery engine that uses AI algorithms to surface listings that align with the guest’s behavior, search history, and preferences. Beyond traditional search filters, the system can leverage collaborative filtering, NLP-based sentiment analysis from reviews, or clustering models to recommend listings, improving both relevance and conversion.

### **User Story 3: Host Property Management Portal**

**As a host,**
I want a simple interface to add, update, or remove property listings, including uploading images, setting availability, and defining pricing,
**so that** I can effectively promote and manage my rental spaces on the platform.

**Definition:**
This feature enables hosts to control their inventory. It includes CRUD operations for listings, calendar management, dynamic pricing tools, and media uploads. It’s designed for usability and integrates with backend validation and image optimization services. The system must also support moderation workflows to ensure listings meet quality and safety standards before becoming public.

### **User Story 4: End-to-End Booking and Payment Process**

**As a guest,**
I want to be able to select available dates, submit a booking request, and pay securely using my preferred method,
**so that** I can confirm my stay and have assurance that my transaction is protected.

**Definition:**
This story covers the full booking lifecycle: availability validation, booking reservation, and secure payment gateway integration. It includes session timeouts, fraud detection, and automatic booking confirmation or host approval steps. The system should support multiple payment methods (e.g., cards, mobile money, wallets) and issue receipts, all while complying with security standards like PCI-DSS.

### **User Story 5: Administrative Oversight & Control Panel**

**As a system administrator,**
I want access to a central dashboard where I can monitor, verify, and manage users, listings, transactions, and reported issues,
**so that** I can maintain platform compliance, trustworthiness, and operational integrity.

**Definition:**
This story describes the administrative backend, which includes moderation tools, user and listing management, financial oversight, fraud reporting, and analytics. Admins can deactivate accounts, resolve disputes, and generate reports. The system should support role hierarchies (e.g., support agents, super admins), audit logs, and possibly AI-powered flagging for suspicious activities.
